## About

E-RayZer is a **self-supervised 3D vision model** that:
- 🎯 **Predicts camera poses** from multi-view images without ground truth camera parameters
- 🏗️ **Reconstructs 3D scenes** as Gaussian splats for high-quality rendering
- 🔄 **Synthesizes novel views** from arbitrary camera positions
- 📸 **Requires ~10 RGB images** of a scene from different viewpoints (no camera calibration needed)

Built on transformer architecture with differentiable Gaussian splatting. For detailed information about training data requirements and format specifications, see [`DATASET_AND_TRAINING.md`](DATASET_AND_TRAINING.md).

## Repository Map
- `gradio_app.py`: End-to-end demo UI backed by the inference engine.
- `app_core/engine.py`: Thin wrapper that loads configs, checkpoints, and exports renders, Gaussian point clouds, and turntable videos.
- `erayzer_core/`: Model, transformer blocks, and Gaussian renderer used at inference time.
- `config/erayzer.yaml`: Default inference configuration (image sizes, number of views, view selector, transformer depth, etc.).
- `examples/`: Five curated multi-view sets for quick validation.
- `third_party/gsplat/`: Differentiable Gaussian splatting ops (with our intrinsics-gradient support).
- **[`DATASET_AND_TRAINING.md`](DATASET_AND_TRAINING.md)**: Detailed information about the model, training data requirements, and data format specifications.

## Quick Start

### 1. Create the environment
```bash
conda create -n erayzer python=3.10 -y
conda activate erayzer

pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e third_party/gsplat/  # This takes time
```
### 2. Download or place checkpoints
- `checkpoints/erayzer_multi.pt`: Multi-dataset model (default for the demo).
- `checkpoints/erayzer_dl3dv.pt`: Model trained on DL3DV only.

The Gradio demo automatically downloads missing weights on first launch. You can also fetch them manually from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/qitaoz/E-RayZer/tree/main/checkpoints) and drop the files into `checkpoints/`. Update `--ckpt` if you store them elsewhere.

### 3. Launch the Gradio app
```bash
python gradio_app.py \
	--config config/erayzer.yaml \
	--ckpt checkpoints/erayzer_multi.pt \
	--device cuda:0 \
	--output-dir outputs \
	--share
```
- Upload 10-ish multi-view RGB images (the engine pads/repeats if you provide fewer). You can also click one of the bundled examples to preload sample views.
- Press **Run Inference**. The demo writes predicted camera poses, target renders, a Gaussian point cloud (`point_cloud.glb`), a sweep video (`render_video.mp4`), and a zipped archive under `outputs/<timestamp>/`.
- `--share` exposes the interface through Gradio tunnels; drop the flag to keep it local.
